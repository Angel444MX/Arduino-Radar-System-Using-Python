## Arduino-Radar-System-Using-Python
Step-by-step learning journey building an Arduino radar system with Python visualization

## Project Overview
This repository highlights my approach to building a radar system I came across on Youtube, the idea is to first master each component individually before integration. 
Rather than jumping directly to the final product, I've broken down the project into six progressive stages, each building upon the skills learned in the previous one.

## Final Goal
A continuously scanning radar system that uses an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor to detect objects at various angles, with real-time visualization in Python.

## Project Progression: 
  # Project 1: Ultrasonic Sensor Basics: understanding distance measurement with HC-SR04 sensor
  # Project 2: Servo Motor Control: precise servo positioning and sweeping
  # Project 3: Sensor-Servo Integration: combining sensor and servo with basic scanning logic
  # Project 4: Accurate Distance Readings: improving measurement reliability and accuracy
  # Project 5: Multi-Angle Scanning: implementing systematic scanning patterns
  # Final Project: Complete Radar System: continuous scanning with Python visualization
  

## Software Requirements
  # Arduino IDE
  # Python 
    *** will update the modules used later ***

## Documentation
  # Each project folder will try to contain:
    - README.md with detailed project documentation
    - Circuit diagrams used as visual wiring guides
    - Logic flow diagrams for program structure visualization
    - Source code with fully commented Arduino/Python code
    - Images potentially photos of actual builds (tend to forget to take photos)
